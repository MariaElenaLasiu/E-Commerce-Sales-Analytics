# E-Commerce Sales Analytics

## Overview

This project involves the development of an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyse e-commerce sales data, providing actionable insights on **product performance, customer behaviour, and profitability**. The dataset contains transactional sales records from an online retail store, covering purchases from customers across different regions.

## Objectives

The primary aim of this project is to extract meaningful insights from e-commerce sales data to support data-driven decision-making. The analysis focuses on:

**1. Sales Performance Analysis**

- Measuring overall revenue, profits, and returns over time
- Identifying sales trends and seasonal variations
  
**2.Product Performance Evaluation**

- Determining the top revenue-generating and best-selling products
  
**3.Customer Behaviour Insights**

- Understanding purchasing habits and frequency
- Analysing new vs. returning customer trends
- Measuring customer retention and estimating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

**4.Geographical Sales Distribution**

- Identifying key revenue-contributing regions
- Assessing market concentration and growth opportunities

## Data cleaning

A **structured, professional data cleaning and transformation proces**s was executed in Power Query, ensuring high data integrity, consistency, and optimised performance. The process included:

**1. Handling Missing Values with a Business Perspective:**

- Null CustomerID values were retained as guest users to avoid data loss
- Ensured no blank Invoice IDs, guaranteeing completeness in transaction records

**2. Returns & Refund Handling:**

- Created a separate table to track first purchases
- Implemented a new vs. returning customer classification based on purchase date and first purchase date

**3. Deduplication & Ensuring Data Integrity:**

- Removed exact duplicate transactions based on StockCode, InvoiceDate, CustomerID, and InvoiceNo
- Did not apply fuzzy matching or partial merging, prioritising transaction clarity over approximation

**4. Data Modelling & Structuring for Scalability:**

- Developed a Products table with aggregated metrics (average price, total quantity, and total revenue per product)
- This table is dynamically updated, ensuring real-time tracking of product performance

**5. Standardisation & Formatting Improvements:**

- Applied text-to-numeric conversions where necessary to enhance calculation efficiency
- Standardised product descriptions (trimmed and uppercased) for consistency

**6. Power Query Transformations & DAX Calculations:**

- Used Power Query to reshape and clean data but did not leverage parameterised queries or custom functions
